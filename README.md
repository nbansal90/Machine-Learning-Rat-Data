# Machine-Learning-Rat-Data

Employed Various Explanatory techniques Such as :
Principle Component Analysis
Multi Dimensional Scaling

Employed  Various Machine Learning Algorithms to the Data set for the  
classfication Classes Namely:
Genotype, TreatMent, Behavior and Class.

Comaparitive Study Between Different Algorithms suggested,
Random Forrest Giving a better result when comapared to LDA and
SVM based Approach.
